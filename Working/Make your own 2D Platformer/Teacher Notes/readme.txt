In the past, have finished going through the content on day 1, other times was looking for additional things to do for second part of day 2...


Optional things to consider.

 - Play LightBot, a simple game to program a robot...
 - Program a simple pong game in lua and love2D...



another task: - GOOD
-------------------------
Give every student pens and paper.
have each student draw a simple image, a square house, arrows, etc...

pare the students together.
one person will act as an "Interpreter"
the other person will act as the "Programmer"

The "Programmer" can give commands to the "interpreter"
 - Pen Up
 - Pen Down
 - Move North / South / East / West / NE / NW / SE / SW

the interpreter should interpres the instructions to draw the image the programmer had previously drawn...
when they have finished the drawing, swap roles, the programmer can be the interpreter, and the interpreter can be the programmer.

this could take an hour...
